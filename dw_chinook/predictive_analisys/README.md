# *If I have R$ 1.000.000,00 to invest on music licences, what is the composition of the music portfolio that brings the highest return on investment at the lowest payback ?*

## Extra Challenges (you can go for one, two or all of them):

* ## Plot a 5-dimensional graph, a line-histogram composition graph and a box-plot graph.

> Prize: Think Big start at StarMeUp and a "Can perform with limited supervision" on Data Visualization at Glow

> Description: Plot a 5-dimensional graph, explaining each dimension and the reason to support your claims with that graph. Use the other two to support your claims statistically. Can’t contain identification fields, like primary and foreign keys.

* ## Elaborate a probability distribution estimation and conformity analysis for 5 variables.

> Prize: Excellence in Your Work star at StarMeUp and a "Can perform with limited supervision" on Statistical Analysis at Glow.

> Description: Plot 5 graphs, together with the required statistical analysis, that validates the best-suited Probability Density Function for 5 variables (one from each dimension). Should include the sample histogram and a line with the estimated values and parameters for the distribution. Can’t contain identification fields, like primary and foreign keys. If you’re going for challenge 3, keep only one at the presentation but get all others ready.

* ## Tell a story, in at most 5 minutes and with 3 slides, that answers the proposed question.

> Prize: Excellence in Your Work star at StarMeUp and a "Can perform with limited supervision" on Storytelling at Glow.

> Description: Use concepts of data visualization to explain, at most in 5 minutes and with 3 slides (include additional title and ending slides), with Globant’s visual identity. This presentation should contain the major arguments for your answer and it must be unique, factible and provide high-value insights for C-Level decision making. Use only small text and include a graph on each slide.

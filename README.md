# Chinnok Music-Store Data

This repository was created to implement a Dimensional Modeling based at the Chinook DataBase found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdelazizelsawy/chinook-music-store-data/data?select=chinook.db), where was extracted an sqlite [chinook.db](/chinook.db) file and then generated a [ddl statement](/chinook/ddl/chinook.sql) to create the data into a Postgres DB.

### *The original schema diagram was:*

### *Which was transformed to a star schema*
